# ROT13 Algorithm
ROT13 ("rotate by 13 places", usually hyphenated ROT-13) is a simple Caesar cipher used for obscuring text by replacing each letter with the letter thirteen places down the alphabet.

Applying ```ROT13``` to a piece of text merely requires examining its alphabetic characters and replacing each one by the letter 13 places further along in the alphabet, wrapping back to the beginning if necessary.[2] ```A``` becomes ```N```, ```B``` becomes ```O```, and so on up to ```M```, which becomes ```Z```, then the sequence continues at the beginning of the alphabet: ```N``` becomes ```A```, ```O``` becomes ```B```, and so on to ```Z```, which becomes ```M```. Only those letters which occur in the English alphabet are affected; numbers, symbols, whitespace, and all other characters are left unchanged. Because there are 26 letters in the English alphabet and ```26 = 2 × 13```, the ```ROT13``` function is its own inverse:[2]
